This project is majorly built on HTML and CSS ( with the CSS Flexbox used for building the basic layout ). A Little bit of JavaScript if also used to make it interactive and to apply some hover animations.
The User Interface is mainly for the mobile screens but since the UI is responsive, It looks great on desktop screen too.
